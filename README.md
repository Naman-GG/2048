The 2048 Game
2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game.

The goal is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the
value 2048.

• Gameplay: Players use arrow keys or swipes to move all tiles in a given direction.
• Merging: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with
double their value.
• New Tiles: After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears randomly on
the grid.
• Game Over: The game ends when there are no more legal moves or when the grid is
full.

The challenge lies in planning your moves strategically to create higher-valued tiles and
avoid filling the grid prematurely.
